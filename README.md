The purpose of the Net-Project-Package-Extractor is process all the .csproj files in a directory (and subdirectories) and extract nuget information that is saved to a spreadsheet. This can be used as an appendix to the ECSS Software Reuse File. The Net-Project-Package-Extractor is available on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nppe) as a dotnet tool called `nppe`.

Please read the [Quick Start](https://github.com/RHEAGROUP/Net-Project-Package-Extractor/wiki/Quick-Start) to find out how to use the `nppe` dotnet tool
